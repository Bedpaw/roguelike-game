ABOUT US:

This project was made by Pati, Paweł and Wojtek as a one of the tasks from CODECOOL.

But who knows what will happen with it next ...

Maybe it will be known as "Best RPG terminal game in whole history?"

Scheme of the game was prepaired by Paweł, then Wojtek started to create colorful board.
Monsters were born in Paweł's mind and breeds of Heroes were an idea of Wojtek.
Items, logo, and menu were created by Pati.
