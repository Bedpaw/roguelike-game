Hello traveller, what are you doing here?
  [1] What happened to your face? <There is a big wound just over king's right ear>
    Trolls...the strongest troll that I have ever seen... he wants to eat my brain &01
      [1] Hmmm, I think I saw him before, it looks like he is a king of the cave trolls
        Exactly, and now he is building troll army to attack my city, i can't stop him because east dangerous is even worse and i need to save my warrios... &01
          [1] Maybe I can help you with this monster?
            If you kill him and bring me a prove of that I will let you go east...of course you will get also a lot of many... &0

              [2] No way, I prefer my life than a money! &END
          [2] Maybe you should think about others problem? &END
      [2] You looks really funny with this scar!
        GET OUT! &2
          [1] Ok, ok... don't be so angry &END
  [2] I want to go eastern trail, please tell your guards to let me go
    It's impossible, east is too dangerous now for travellers... &23
      [1] But I'm brave and strong I can go!
        I SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE! Enough blood has already drained in this land &3
          [1] Ok, ok... don't be so angry &END
