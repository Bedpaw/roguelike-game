Hello traveller, what are you doing here?
  [1] Tell me something about this city...
    This is Trollgard city. It was created to fend off troll attacks from western caves... but this times trolls aren't the biggest problem &01
      [1] Whaaaaat, I have just came from their caves, this monsters are terrible, but worse they are stinking as hell
        You came from troll caves and I have'nt seen any wounds on your body! You are terrible liar or hero that i need! Answer me now! &01
          [1] I'm hero!
            I have lost my golden ring, when I was fighting troll king last time, I can't move from there, because I need to recover... &01
              [1] So you want me to go caves for searching trinkets? How can I find something so small!
                Trolls are stupid, but they love trinkets, I'm sure that one of them find it and hide im some small tear in ground or a cave_wall &0
                  [1] Ok, I will find, but I want a great reward! &QUEST0
              [2] I thought you have so important mission, I have better things to do &END
          [2] I'm liar...
            I knew that there are no more hope for me... GET OUT! &23
              [1] I'm sorry that I let you down... &END
              [2] Everyone has their own problems... &END
      [2] You are boring... &END
