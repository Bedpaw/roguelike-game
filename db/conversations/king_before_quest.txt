Hello traveller, what are you doing here?
  [1] Tell me something about this city...
    This is Trollgard city. It was created to fend off troll attacks from eastern caves... but this times trolls aren't the biggest problem
      [1] Whaaaaat, I have just came from their caves, this monsters are terrible, but worse they are stinking as hell
        You came from troll caves and I have'nt seen any wounds on your body! You are terrible liar or hero that i need! Answer me now!
          [1] I'm hero!
          [2] I'm liar...
            I knew that there are no more hope for me... GET OUT!
              [1] I'm sorry that I let you down... &END
              [2] Everyone has their own problems... &END
      [2] You are boring... &END
  [2] What what happened to your face? <There is a big wound just over right ear>
    Trolls...the strongest troll that I have ever seen... he wants to eat my brain
      [1] Hmmm, I think I saw him before, it looks like he is a king of the cave trolls
  [3] I want to go western trail, please tell your guards to let me go
    It's impossible, west is too dangerous now to for travellers...
      [1] But I'm brave and strong I can go!
        I SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE! Enough blood has already drained in this land
          [1] Ok, ok... don't be so angry &END
      [2] I will stay town then... &END
  [4] I hear a lot about you alchemical talent king. Can I buy something from your collection? &TRADE
